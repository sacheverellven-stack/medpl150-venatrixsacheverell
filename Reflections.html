<p>  Susan Sontag’s ‘In Plato’s Cave’ presents the reality of photographs.  They are yet mirrors held up to the past, both preservative of it, but also warping of it.  Photography as a tool is as much art as any other widely accepted medium, as it has the power to tell a story.  Nevertheless, it has many applications beyond what we would typically consider ‘art’.  It captures a moment in time and preserves it for as long as its film - or power source - lasts.
	There is an interesting timeline laid out in ‘In Plato’s Cave’.  That timeline spans from large ‘contraptions’ to small pocket-sized cameras.  In this way, cameras have become markers for progress.  Each era since its inception has been marked by its own style of camera, and as such also by its own style of photo.  There is something about pictures of the past that cannot be replicated in modern images, and indeed, this is the way in which photography documents the past.  One might argue its existence is inherently as a documentation, even when it is used in the most abstract manner possible.
	A camera is not inherently biased.  It may be used to propagandize, as all media may, but it is unbiased.  As such, so long as the truth surrounding a photo is applied to it, then we are aware of the past in a manner that is only jaded by our own prejudices.  Furthermore, now more than ever, photography is accessible to the masses.  Obtaining a camera is much easier now than it was one hundred years ago, and, as they can be pocket-sized and even disposable, they are not the commitment they once were.  Nevertheless, as photographs are unbiased, they can be damning against those aiming to deceive - with a photo comes proof and with proof comes power.  This means that activists can disprove the claims of tyrants, and officers of the law can gather evidence related to a crime.
	Yet, cameras are also a means of division.  Photos can be used to slander and blackmail.  In our modern era, photography is tied to revenge porn and stalking.  Photographs are not just items of whimsy and fact, but also of emotion, particularly lust and revenge.  While it is, in most cases, not legal to do these sorts of things with a camera, it often doesn’t matter that it’s not, as taking photos is not seen as insidious in our society, and most would assume a photographer’s intention to be banal.  Furthermore, once a picture is taken, it can easily be disseminated, especially on the internet, which makes it difficult to contain the spread of.  Photography can both enchant and ruin one’s life.
	Ultimately, photographs are treated as relics of the past, and as such the amount they can ruin one’s life is finite.  Photos are treated as relics of their time, rather than as something whose influence should persist.  An inflammatory photo from 1900 is not looked on the way an inflammatory photo from yesterday is. After a fashion, no one will care that you were seen in such a compromising position, you’ll fade into the background too.
