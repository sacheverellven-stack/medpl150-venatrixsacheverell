<p>Venatrix Sacheverell is a Manhattan-based photographer.  Her work focuses on the urban and natural landscapes, and abandoned spaces.  She seeks to display spaces that are out of the way, untouched, or forgotten.  In this way, she captures the spirit of America's dying industry and migration towards urban centers.</p>
